The YPP RPC Mesh Proxy is now running on your Kubernetes cluster.
1. External access from outside the cluster is available via the IP address:
    {{ include "mesh-proxy.fullname" . }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}
2. Internal access from application within the cluster:
    NODE_IP:{{ .Values.service.targetPort }}
   NODE_IP is the IP address of the node where the application is running, which can be obtained by status.hostIP.
